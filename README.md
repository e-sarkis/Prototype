# Prototype Pattern Study
[Prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern) is a programming pattern with intent defined by [Source Making](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/prototype) as purposed to:
>Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

This project has implemented the pattern to handle terrain as explained in [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob)'s book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/prototype.html).
